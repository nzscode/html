                            Summer brings a windfall of berries — blueberries,
                            strawberries, raspberries and blackberries — just
                            waiting to be served atop yogurt, blended in a
                            smoothie or baked into a summer pie. Berries are
                            best stored unwashed in the refrigerator and eaten
                            within a few days. Wash just before eating for the
                            optimal berry experience.

                                Another sun-loving plant is yarrow, a tall plant
                                that resembles cauliflower. Yarrow likes soil
                                with good drainage and plenty of hot days. If
                                your soil is heavy clay or consistently damp,
                                yarrow may not be as successful. Yarrow is
                                rabbit- and deer-resistant.

                                much maintenance. Yarrow is a classic element in

                                This flower, also called “speedwell,” gets that
                                name for its quick, no-nonsense growth pattern.
                                Veronica loves a full sun environment and will
                                live up to its name most if it gets to drink in
                                the sun. However, Veronica will also thrive in
                                part shade.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Consider Veronica the outdoor equivalent of the
                                famous snake plant. Both varieties seem to
                                almost thrive on neglect. Veronica will continue
                                to bloom without giving it any care, so consider
                                this plant if you have a natural garden that you
                                want to grow wild and organically eventually.

                                The hardy shrub version of the culinary herb
                                sage, salvia, is another easy-to-grow perennial
                                that is a Zone 6 perennial. Salvia is a member
                                of the mint family, so this plant is rugged and
                                will tolerate many different growing conditions.
                                Summer heat and mild drought are ok with salvia.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Salvia is a quickly-growing plant that will grow
                                back year after year. This plant easily attracts
                                butterflies and other beneficial pollinators.
                                Salvia flowers range from common purple spikes
                                to pinks, blues, yellows, and even white.

                                the rose is hardy to Zone 6. Roses can be grown
                                as a bush or small tree and are covered in
                                prickly thorns. This flower is notorious for its

                                fertilizer and pruning.

                                enchanting smell, along with their beauty. This
                                flower comes in a variety of amazing colors,

                                and even the modern rainbow.

                                The peony is an iconic Zone 6 perennial flower
                                known for its enormous, globe-shaped blooms. The
                                peony drinks in a full sun environment with
                                well-drained soil. This flower grows from a
                                small, rounded bush with glossy foliage.

                                If you decide to grow a peony, keep in mind that
                                peony flowers will become covered in ants. The
                                ants do not hurt the flower and instead are just
                                enjoying the flower's sticky nectar.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Remember to dip the blooms in warm tap water
                                when you bring the flowers inside to sweep the
                                ants away. This water bath will encourage the
                                flower to open up as a bonus.

                                Another cottage garden classic, hydrangeas, is a
                                thrilling Zone 6 perennial. This plant can be
                                grown into a tall tree, small shrub, or hedge
                                shape. This versatile perennial appreciates full
                                sun or partial shade and moist, well-drained
                                soil. An afternoon break from sunshine is
                                needed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Hydrangea plants produce enormous, ice cream
                                cone-shaped flowers in white, blue, pink, or
                                green. The soil's acidity determines the color
                                of your hydrangeas, so you can manipulate yours
                                to achieve a new color. Hydrangeas are hardy in
                                all weather and pest-resistant.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Watering is most important in hydrangea care. Be
                                sure to monitor the water levels of your plant
                                and keep everything moist. Hydrangeas do not
                                like extended periods of very hot or dry
                                weather.

                                Another addition to the Zone 6 perennials that
                                love the shade is super easy to grow and
                                provides years of visual interest. The hosta
                                plant is a genuinely fantastic variety.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A good reminder for growing hostas is that the
                                lighter the plant's greenery, the more sunshine
                                it needs. Dark green hostas can thrive in very
                                shady areas, while bright, almost neon green
                                varieties of hostas need more sunlight.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Hostas will bloom in the summer, reaching a long
                                strand of drooping purple or white flowers into
                                the air. Hostas are rugged and can tolerate most
                                soil conditions before starting to spread
                                horizontally quickly.

                                Bee balm, or monarda, is an excellent choice for
                                any gardener looking to add some Zone 6
                                perennials to their landscape. This plant
                                overflows with benefits, and it's not just its
                                pollinator status. This North American native
                                plant is beloved by bees, butterflies, and
                                hummingbirds.

                                This Zone 6 perennial continues to benefit your
                                entire garden ecosystem by serving as a
                                companion plant. Companion planting is the
                                practice of planting certain species of herbs,
                                vegetables, flowers, or other plants together so
                                they can help each other thrive.

                                Bee balm is also known as bergamot and provides
                                a fragrant herb that enhances Earl Grey tea and
                                other teatime pleasures.

                                This popular perennial delivers a shaggy,
                                magenta, purple, or white flower at the top that
                                resembles a sea urchin. Bee balm can grow two to
                                four feet tall.

                    <p>THOUGHTS ON GROWING HERBS IN PLANTERS:</p>
                    <p>
                        You'll want to fill the planter with a mix of compost
                        and Potting Soil, which is different from “top soil” or
                        “garden soil” because potting soil contains vermiculite
                        and is light and airy for container gardening. I always
                        recommend using a high quality potting soil, especially
                        when you're growing an edible herb or vegetable garden.
                        Higher quality, organic potting soils contain added
                        nutrients that will keep your herb plants happy
                        throughout their entire first season, and won't poison
                        you when you ingest your food. I do not advocate using
                        Miracle-Gro potting soil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some good brands of potting soil are: Fox Farm Ocean
                        Forest Potting Soil -or- Vermont Compost Company Organic
                        Potting Soil

                                CHIVES. Plant 1-2 onion chive plants and they
                                will keep getting bigger every year with
                                absolutely zero effort.

                                GARLIC CHIVES. Same deal as onion chives but
                                garlic chive plants are a bit smaller so I would
                                plant 4-5.

                                SORREL. If you really want to jazz up your green
                                routine, you have to plant garden sorrel! This
                                is one of the most fun plants in the garden, in
                                my opinion, despite its plain green appearance.
                                The flavor of these green leaves are
                                unbelievable — sour and tangy, amazing raw to
                                brighten up a salad or cooked down in soup.
                                Sorrel is perennial in Zone 6 and will come back
                                bigger every year with no effort.

                                THYME. Regular English Thyme, Lemon Thyme,
                                Orange Balsam Thyme… there are so many fun
                                varieties of thyme available! Plant a few of
                                each of these varieties and watch them grow
                                bigger each year with no effort. You could also
                                try filling in patchy grassy areas in your yard
                                with Creeping Thyme.

                                SAGE. I love growing a combination of Berggarten
                                Sage, Tricolor Sage and Purple Sage. Plant a few
                                individual sage plants and watch them take off
                                and get bigger every year with, again, no effort
                                on your part.

                                OREGANO. Did you know that oregano produces the
                                most lovely pink, white or purple flowers in the
                                summer? I actually sell them as cut flowers on
                                my flower farm! Plant a delicious Greek Oregano
                                plant and watch it get bigger every year with
                                zero effort.

                                MINT. Every person ever will tell you not to
                                plant mint in your garden or it will take over.
                                I encourage you to plant as much mint as you
                                want… in a pot! That way the mint will be
                                contained and won’t take over your entire
                                garden. It will still come back every year in
                                the pot, even in the most frigid of temperatures
                                over winter. Chocolate Mint, Applemint, Ginger
                                Mint or Peppermint… there are so many fun mints
                                to choose from; wish I had room for them all.

                                LAVENDER. What is better than a lavender border
                                around your entire herb or veggie garden? This
                                is exactly what I’ve done in my backyard using
                                my favorite French ‘Grosso’ variety. In Zone 6,
                                Spanish lavenders will not come back after the
                                winter, but I’ve had much success growing
                                English and French lavender varieties as long as
                                they are planted in a spot where soil freely
                                drains.

                                RHUBARB. Plant rhubarb with a crown (root).
                                Rhubarb is one of my favorite plants to have in
                                the garden because the pink growing tips will
                                begin popping out of the ground in very early
                                Spring… a sign that so much beauty is yet to
                                come! Rhubarb plants get huge (like zucchini),
                                so make sure to give this one a lot of space.
                                Rhubarb will grow best in the ground, not in a
                                planter.

                                PARSLEY. Curly or Italian parsley will come back
                                for several years in Zone 6, and will self-seed
                                for new plants in the future. We grow through a
                                ton of parsley in our house and we’ve saved so
                                much money on this one patch of parsley alone!
                                We have about a dozen plants in the ground, and
                                parsley will also do well in a planter.

                                LOVAGE. Lovage is an herb with an incredibly
                                unique flavor that I describe as “celery on
                                steroids.” The flavor of lovage is pungent but
                                so interesting that I’ve planted it in multiple
                                planting beds in my backyard. Not only is lovage
                                great for infusing into vinegars, the plant
                                itself grows an umbellifer-type flower which
                                attracts hoverflies and other beneficial
                                predatory insects that will help keep other
                                flying garden pests under control. Lovage gets
                                tall (5+ feet) and will grow best in the ground,
                                not in a planter.

                                YARROW. I personally don’t eat yarrow, but it is
                                my all-time favorite perennial plant and is
                                considered a medicinal herb in many parts of the
                                world. Interestingly, yarrow (Achillea
                                millefolium) is a coagulant and I have used it
                                to stop bleeding on my cut fingers many times in
                                the farm and when I’ve cut my fingers pretty
                                badly while using a knife in the kitchen. Yarrow
                                leaves, when crushed and applied to a bleeding
                                wound, will stop pain and bleeding almost
                                immediately. Therefore, I’ll always have yarrow
                                around. It comes in lovely colors and will bloom
                                for years in the herb garden. Source Native
