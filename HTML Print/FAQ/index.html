            This page serves to explain why this site was built. I needed
            practice working with HTML & CSS, so built this site through VSCode
            and using HTIHUB for version control and page publishing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have to admit, it is good practice. I also needed this inital FAQ
            page, to serve as a placeholder for some of the definitions of HTML,
            CSS & JS elements
        </p>
